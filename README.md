# User-Story 
- AS A developer who is interested in supporting Californias initiative towards more electric vehicles
- I WANT an EV Charge N Go site to support the efforts in reducing gas emmissions and increasing electric vehicle use 
- SO THAT more individuals can have access to owning or using an electric car regardless of installing a home charger themselves or needing to own a home to access 
- AND SO THAT while traveling out of town, finding stations to reserve in advance to ensure the ability of electric vehicle use 
- WITHOUT obstacles from conveniences



# How to Use this Project and Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN a EV Charge N Go Site
- WHEN I visit the site for the first time
- THEN I am presented homepage, which includes a map and a zip code form to enter your zip code
- WHEN I enter my zip code
- THEN I am prompted to sign up or login in
- WHEN I sign up 
- THEN I must provide an valid email address and password
- WHEN I am done signing up
- THEN I am automatically directed to the home page
- WHEN I am logged in and my username appears on the top right side of the home page
- THEN I can add a charging startion OR make a reservation
- WHEN I add a charging station
- THEN I have to fill out the station form
- WHEN I make a reservation
- THEN I have to fill out the reservation form
- WHEN I made the reservation
- THEN I go to My Reservations
- WHEN I go to My Reservations
- THEN all my reservations appear with detail station information, along with date and time of reservation
- WHEN I go to My Charging Stations
- THEN all the charging stations I own will appear in one page
- WHEN 
- THEN 
- WHEN
- THEN


# Motivation for Development
- We all came to an agreement that EV Charging isnt easily accessible and a gap for EV owners and station owners exists. Therefore allowing owners of stations to rent out home stations and also supporting EV drivers to a wider range of charging access better supports the future mission.  


# Features




# Process
- Topic / Project defined
- Defined a high level breakdown of the project
- Worked together creating the models
- Models helped define the various work packages and tasks required to complete the project
- Assigned tasks to team members
- Lots of collaboration throughout
    - working together via zooms, meetings, slack, etc to help with suo coding and/or brainstorming how to effectively move ahead in the process



## Technology
- Trello was used to help define tasks, schedule, and ownership throughout the different phases of the project.
- HTML
- CSS3
- Vanilla Javascript
- Handlebars
- Heroku

## Challenges
<!-- trim error -- making a reservation-->
- reseration.js 
<!-- reserve a length of reservation -->
- duration 
- rendering registration 
- correct station id wasn't showing



## Successes 

- Connecting Google API to application 
- Connecting the logged in user to their reservations while also displaying station information
- Having various icon types for different plug in and level type chargers registered
- Defining the flow and linkages between the various stages 
- Connecting the station registration 


## Demo

Screenshots of application usage along with links to deployed site below. 


# Directions for Future Development

## Short Term Goals 
- Comment section
- Ability to delete prior reservations
- Start and finish time reservation 
- Calendar view for station 

## Long Term Goals
- Station Reviews
- Send welcome email to user
- Ability to chat with owner
- Filter options such as price, charger types, etc.
